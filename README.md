## Overview
This project explores the integration of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques in the field of topology optimization. Leveraging the TOP dataset, the study presents a comprehensive approach to optimizing structural designs using advanced neural network architectures.

### Key Features
- Utilization of the TOP dataset comprising 10,000 scenarios for robust ML model training.
- Implementation of various neural network architectures, including an Encoder-Decoder Net model inspired by the U-Net architecture.
- Detailed analysis of neural network performance in structural optimization tasks.

## Neural Network Architectures
1. **Encoder-Decoder Net Model**: A complex model designed for detailed image processing.
2. **Smaller Network**: A streamlined version of the U-Net architecture, offering a compact design.
3. **Tiny Neural Network**: A lightweight model, ideal for simpler tasks.

## Dataset
The TOP dataset consists of solutions for 10,000 randomly generated scenarios on a 40Ã—40 grid. It provides a detailed view of the optimization process over 100 iterations, ensuring a thorough understanding of topology optimization challenges.
